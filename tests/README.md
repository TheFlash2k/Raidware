# TESTS

This folder will contain some scripts that will automate the testing process for me as a developer.

--- 

1. login.py - This will automatically log-in as `Raidware` and then fetch the token and store it.

- auto.py - This file will be the most useful to me as it will perform the following tasks:
    - Log in as user `Raidware`
    - Prepare a listener.
    - Enable a listener.
